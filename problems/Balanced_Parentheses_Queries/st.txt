Balanced Parentheses Queries
time limit per test4 seconds
memory limit per test512 megabytes
You are given a Parentheses String S
 ( a string that only contains ( and ) ) of length n
 and q
 queries, each query contains an integer i
 means invert the character of S
 at index i
 ( if it is ( make it ), or if it is ) make it ( ). After each query determine if the string S
 is a Balanced Parentheses Sequence or NOT.

A Balanced Parentheses Sequence is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence when inserted in certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.

Input
First line contains n(6≤n≤105)
 , and q(1≤q≤2×105)

The second line contains S
 |S|=n
.

Next q
 lines each contains an integer i
 (1≤i≤n)

Output
For each Query Print YES
 if the string obtained after performing the ith
 query is a Balanced Parentheses Sequence, NO
 otherwise.

NOTE: the answer is case-sensitive.
