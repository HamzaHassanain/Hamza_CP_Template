In Al-Arish (where Hamza is From) Hamza's parents noticed the bad effects of video games so they decided to do something about that. They decided to advise all other parents they could reach about the bad effects of video games. Here we represent Al-Arish as an n×n 2D Grid g where:

"#" means a market that sells video games (They can do nothing about that). "." means parents that are not advised yet.
"P" means parents that are advised about the bad effects of video games.
Now they will follow the following plan:

Draw a square of size (2×w+1)×(2×w+1) around each advised parent P where P lies exactly at the center of the square.
Go to all parents that are not advised yet "." and advise them (Mark it with P)
Go to all advised parents and repeat the process.

Now Hamza is very busy so he gives you the initial representation of Al-Arish, and the integer w, and asks you to help him find the final representation of the city after the process ends.


Input
First line contains two integers n, w, (3≤n≤1000) and (1≤w≤10) 

NOTE: (2×w+1≤n)

Next n lines each line contains a string of length n. each string contains only ".", "#" , "P"

Note that the whole grid contains exactly one "P".

Output  
Print n lines each line contains a string of length n. each string contains only ".", "#" , "P"
