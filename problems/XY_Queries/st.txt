XY Queries (Easy Version)
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Note: There is a significant difference between the easy version and the hard version so read them both carefully.

Given array a
 of length n
 and m
 queries where each query contains two integers x,y
 and for each query you have to check if there exists any i,j
 (1≤i,j≤n)
 (Note: i and j can be equal) in the array a
 such that a[i]
 and
 a[j]
 satisfy the following conditions:

a[i]
 + a[j]
 =
 x
.
a[i]
 - a[j]
 =
 y
.
Input
The First line contains the integer n
 (1≤n≤103)
 the size of the array a
.

The Second line contains n
 integers a1......an
 (−109≤ai≤109)
 where ai
 is the i−th
 element in the array

The Third lien contains the integer m
 (1≤m≤102)
 the number of queries.

Next m
 lines contains two integers x,y
 (−2×109≤x,y≤2×109)

Output
For each query print Yes
 if there exists any i,j
 satisfies the above conditions otherwise print No

Note: The answer is case sensitive
