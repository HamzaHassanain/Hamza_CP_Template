You are given an array a
 of n
 integers and an integer k
. Additionally, there are q
 queries, each represented by two integers l
 and r
.

For each query, you need to output the count of pairs (i,j)
 where l≤i<j≤r
 and the bitwise XOR (⊕
) of a[i]
 and a[j]
 is smaller than or equal to k
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104)
 — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n
, k
, and q
 (2≤n,q≤2×104
, 0≤k<230)
 — the size of the array, the threshold k
, and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (0≤ai<230)
 — the elements of the array.

Each of the next q
 lines contains two integers l
 and r
 (1≤l<r≤n)
 — representing a query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅104
,

and the sum of q
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅104
.

Output
For each query, output a single integer — the count of pairs (i,j)
 such that l≤i<j≤r
 and a[i]⊕a[j]≤k
.

Output a new line between test cases.
